This repository contains my Python DSA learning journey, where I practice and implement core data structures and algorithms from scratch to build strong problem-solving skills.

1. The goal of this repository is to:

2. Understand how DSA works internally

3. Improve coding logic

4. Prepare for coding interviews & competitive programming
